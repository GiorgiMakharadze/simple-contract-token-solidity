# Very Simple Token contract

## Overview

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named `CryptoToken`. It's a basic implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities for token minting and transfer, ensuring a fundamental understanding of how token contracts operate in a blockchain environment.

## Features

- **Token Minting**: The contract allows a designated minter (the deployer of the contract) to mint new tokens.
- **Token Transfer**: Any holder of the tokens can transfer them to another address.
- **Balance Tracking**: The contract keeps track of the token balances of each address.

## Contract Details

- `CryptoToken.sol`: The main contract file containing the Solidity code for the token.

## Requirements

To interact with this contract, you will need:

- An Ethereum wallet (like MetaMask).
- Some Ether in your wallet to deploy the contract and perform transactions.
- A Solidity development environment (like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat) for deployment.

## Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**: If you're using a development framework like Truffle or Hardhat, ensure you have it installed.
2. **Compile the Contract**: Compile `CryptoToken.sol` using your Solidity compiler or development environment.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the contract to your chosen network (Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc.). Ensure you have enough Ether for deployment.
4. **Interact**: Use your Ethereum wallet or a web3 interface to interact with the deployed contract.

## Usage

- **Mint Tokens**: Call the `mint` function with the receiver's address and the amount of tokens to mint.
- **Send Tokens**: Call the `send` function with the receiver's address and the amount of tokens to send.
